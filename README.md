# Through systematic data cleaning techniques, this project aims to transform a raw Kaggle dataset on [layoffs](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022) into a refined, high-quality dataset ready for subsequent stages of analysis and modeling and then through data exploration techniques to formulate certain insights from the data.
